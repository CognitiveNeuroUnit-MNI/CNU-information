# Desk Assignment for the 251-254-247 Areas

This repository contains the the current official desk assignment in a static image format, and the editable template to update the desk assignment each semester.

##
Note to the CNU space committee member in charge of updating the desk-assignment plans:

The template/ directory contains a modifiable powerpoint document to edit and update desk assignments when trainees come and go.

This powerpoint cannot be viewed and edited from Github on the browser. Simply click on the file and hit Download or View Raw to download it to your computer and make the edits. Export the slides as JPG or PNG before uploading them to the repository so everyone can see the updates.
