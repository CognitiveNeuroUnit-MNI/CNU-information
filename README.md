# General information and organization documents

This repository contains information and resources for trainees and reserachers of the Cognitive Neuroscience Unit at the MNI.
It is meant to be a living repository which should be updated regualrly to reflect the current organization of the Unit.

This README file contains the most essential information to get you started in the unit

## About
* When in doubt, ask your supervisor, lab mates or the person sitting next to you.
* If that doesn't work out, Gabriel will be happy to help you out (gabriel.pelletier@mcgill.ca, find me in room 251-H)

## How we stay in touch

## Testing Rooms
* Three testing rooms located in 251 Area are shared between labs of the unit.
* The keys to these rooms are in the lock-box (see details below).
#### Booking
* Testing room schedules are managed with a Google Calendar (one for each room). Ask a fellow cognitive neuroscientist to add you to the calendar.

## Keys and door codes
#### Main 251 area
A code is needed to enter 251. You probably know it already, otherwise ask a fellow cognitive neuroscientist.
#### Personnal workspace
* Most rooms need a key to get into. If your assigned desk is in one of those, Annie will provide a key for you and keep your name on a precious sheet of paper to make sure that you bring it back when you finish your degree.
#### Lock-box
* There is a safe/lock-box on the wall in front of the kitchen door. 
* It contains the keys to the testing room, and spare keys for some of the shared rooms. These keys should return to the safe as soon as you are done with them and should never leave the Unit.
* Ask a fellow cognitive neroscientist for the code to open the safe.

## Desk Assignment
Trainees can be assigned a working space in the 251 Area (extending to 257 and 254). Refer to the desk-assignment folder contained within this repository to view the current desk-assignment. Ask your PI.
